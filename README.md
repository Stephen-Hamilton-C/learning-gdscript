# learning-gdscript
Simple Godot project to learn how GDScript works.
All gd scripts have my own notes from tutorials and articles I'm looking at.

I'm coming from a background of Unity and knowing a lot of other languages like C, C#, C++, Java, and Kotlin.
So far, this feels most similar to Lua and Python, but if Lua had much more powerful syntax and Python didn't suck.
